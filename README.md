# FlaskMySQLWebApp
 
# This is a Web App made in my Database Systems class for a company MUC, where I was responsible for creating the entire database and just fill in each table through parsing the provided '.json' files.

# This Web App can be used to track a Company's Suppliers, Orders, Parts and update various information on suppliers. The webapp can also be used to calculate projected budgets and annual expenses.

# This Application can be accessed by running the Bash Script in CreatePartsTable folder and followed by the bash script in CreateSuppliersOrdersTables folder. Once completed, the app.py should be accessible and ready to run. I would suggest Changing the MySQL Usernames and Passwords in each file accordingly to your accounts credentials.
